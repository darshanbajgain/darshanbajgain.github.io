                <div class="post-content">
                    <p>
                        Information technology has changed the administration, as IT is now an integral part of 
                        government-funded agencies, and public and private firms. But still there is a need of a paradigm shift in our education system.
                         IT must be its integral part. There are many universities and colleges offering IT courses in Nepal. But is there a match between the syllabus, the competence of the learners,
                         and the requirements of the firms? The government has no clear roadmap on this. But this is by no means solely government business.
                    </p>
                    <div class="img-container">
                        <img src="../images/My Post.jpg" width="960" height="640" />
                    </div>
                    <h1>What Kind Of Problems ?</h1>
                    <p>
                        As IT is a technical subject, there must be more practical knowledge,
                         but in this context, we have more theory portion and very few functional portions. Its 
                         one of the main problem here.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        If a student graduates being topper of the University in any bachelor degreee of computer
                        science, he is not sure if he can get some of his dream job like a programmer, game developer, web
                        developer etc. because the course structure is not so job-skills oriented based. The topper would 
                        get his dream job only if he has been self-practising/doing skills oriented project and had gained the skills he needed.
                    </p>
                    <p> I don't mean that you wouldn't get any job in IT sector by having only a bachelor degree. You can get jobs
                        of posts like IT Officer in <b>Public Service Commission, Nepal</b> (but only if you passed the exam and interviews conducted by it) 
                        or become a Teacher in schools etc. This kind of jobs don't need high practical knowledge and skills like software 
                        development, web development etc. But in order to achieve your dream job you can't just depend upon University Course 
                        structures.
                    </p>
                    <h1>Solution Of The Problems</h1>
                    <p>
                        To be skillfull is in the hand of the students. But students don't get much time to manage their
                        skill-upgrading works due to vast theory related exams, assignments, and projects. Students are aware how important
                        is the exam for their degree certificate and also aways concerned about their skills which is needed for the job.
                        Both bachelor degree and skills are needed for students. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        So the solution is that the course structure of the university in IT sector should be made more practical
                        and the students should also be given proper internship for upgrading their skills as well as getting their bachleor 
                        degree.
                    </p>
